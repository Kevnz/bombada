## Known issues

* Doesn't work in IE. My plan from the get-go was to support it, but ... no. Just no.
* When pieces fall they're a little too bouncy when they land. Didn't used to do that. Weird.
* It's too easy. It should have gone through more rounds of testing and tweaking.
* The How-to-play flow is weak sauce. It should be integrated with the gameplay. Out of scope, oh well.
* _Note: desired features can be found in `htdocs/js/bombada.js` comments_
